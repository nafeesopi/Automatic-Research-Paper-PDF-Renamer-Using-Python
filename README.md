# Automatic-Research-Paper-PDF-Renamer-Using-Python
Automatically renames research paper PDFs by detecting real titles from the first page using font-size intelligence. The script scans all PDFs in a folder, finds the largest text with at least 7 words, cleans invalid characters, and renames files properly. Ideal for organizing large literature review folders.
